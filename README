The goal of this project is to solve generalized shceduling problems.

The scheduling problem has the following constraints:
 * x people per group
 * y groups
 * z rounds
where each person is in the same group with another between m and n times.

For example, let's have three groups of two where everyone is in everyone elses group exactly once in 5 rounds.  Assing leters to people A-F a solution would be

Round 1: {A, B} {C, D} {E, F}
Round 2: {A, C} {B, E} {D, F}
Round 3: {A, D} {B, F} {C, E}
Round 4: {A, E} {B, D} {C, F}
Round 5: {A, F} {B, C} {D, F}
